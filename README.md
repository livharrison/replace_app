# Replace App

This is the repository for my web app which reminds me when I need to replace items. This app was born out of my inability to remember to change out my monthly contact lenses, even after installing a contact lens app on my phone. I thought I could make an app that will send me text reminders, which might make me more likely to take action. In addition, I wanted it to be extensible to other items that commonly need to be replaced, such as water filters or oil in your car.

As of March 2025, I am still building out the frontend into a working state, and there is currently no backend or database hooked up. Ideally, I want the notifications to be sent via text message (perhaps through AWS Simple Message Service).
